# MoxGUI Shop Example Project

This is an example project, to display how [Moxvallix's GUI Library](https://github.com/moxvallix/moxgui) works.

Feel free to clone it and do what you like as a jumping off point for using the GUI Library.

There should be comments in most of the functions, explaining how they work.
You can also check `gui/tags/functions`, to see how the function tags are layed out.

Open an ender chest to try out the shop. The currency is diamonds.

You will need to have the GUI Library installed alongside this pack for it to work.
